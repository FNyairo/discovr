Once you have been at space pirate academy for a while, you get your own funky visor. It has various modes. My favourite is the one that allows you to see everything as a large plate of tuna. More important, sections marked for cat-dets with visors goes beyond the core material but is still important and should be studied by all cat-dets. However, try not to be disheartened if you find it difficult.</li>

Those almost as brilliant as Mae (because no-one is quite as brilliant as her) get their own space suits so that they can go on space pirate adventures. They get to shout <em>RRRRRR</em> really loudly too. Actually, everyone here gets to should <em>RRRRRR</em> really loudly. Try it now. Go on. It feels good. Anyway, this material is the most advanced and you can consider it optional unless you are a postgraduate cat-det.</li>

For example, if I want to use the <code>mutate()</code> function from the package <code>dplyr</code>, I will write <code>dplyr::mutate()</code>.</p>
<p>It is good practice to be explicit about packages to avoid clashes where functions from different packages have the same name. It also means that you don’t need to load packages at the start of your markdown document.</p>
<p>There are two main exceptions to this rule.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>There are functions within some <code>tidyverse</code> packages that would be used within other functions. Including the package name makes the code difficult to read. Also, no-one wants to write <code>ggplot2::</code> before every function from <code>ggplot2</code>.</li>
<li>To use the pipe operator (<code>%&gt;%</code>) you need to have <code>magritrr</code> loaded.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can load all of the packages that are exceptions in one step by loading <code>tidyverse</code> at the beginning of our <svg style="height: 1em; top:.04em; position: relative; fill: #7c7da7;" viewBox="0 0 581 512"><path d="M581 226.6C581 119.1 450.9 32 290.5 32S0 119.1 0 226.6C0 322.4 103.3 402 239.4 418.1V480h99.1v-61.5c24.3-2.7 47.6-7.4 69.4-13.9L448 480h112l-67.4-113.7c54.5-35.4 88.4-84.9 88.4-139.7zm-466.8 14.5c0-73.5 98.9-133 220.8-133s211.9 40.7 211.9 133c0 50.1-26.5 85-70.3 106.4-2.4-1.6-4.7-2.9-6.4-3.7-10.2-5.2-27.8-10.5-27.8-10.5s86.6-6.4 86.6-92.7-90.6-87.9-90.6-87.9h-199V361c-74.1-21.5-125.2-67.1-125.2-119.9zm225.1 38.3v-55.6c57.8 0 87.8-6.8 87.8 27.3 0 36.5-38.2 28.3-87.8 28.3zm-.9 72.5H365c10.8 0 18.9 11.7 24 19.2-16.1 1.9-33 2.8-50.6 2.9v-22.1z"/></svg> Markdown document:</p>

<p>Figure 1 shows a general procedure to follow when computing a bivariate correlation coefficient. First, check for sources of bias as outlined. The two most important ones in this context are linearity and normality. Remember that we’re fitting linear model to the data, so if the relationship between variables is not linear then this model is invalid. To meet this requirement, the outcome variable needs to be measured at the interval or ratio level as does the predictor variable (one exception is that a predictor variable can be a categorical variable with only two categories). As far as normality is concerned, we care about this only if we want confidence intervals or significance tests and if the sample size is small.</p>
<p>If the data have outliers, are not normal implying a non-normal sampling distribution (and the sample is small) or your variables are measured at the ordinal level then you can use Spearman’s rho or Kendall’s tau, which are versions of the correlation coefficient applied to ranked data. Ranking the data reduces the impact of outliers but we lose information so, we can instead fit a robust variant such as the percentile bend correlation or Winsorized correlation. Furthermore, given that normality of the sampling distribution matters only for inferring significance and computing confidence intervals in small samples, we could use a bootstrap to compute the confidence interval in small samples, then we don’t need to worry about this assumption.</p>

<p>In a previous tutorial we looked at an example relating to exam anxiety: a psychologist was interested in the effects of exam stress and revision on exam performance. She had devised and validated a questionnaire to assess state anxiety relating to exams (called the Exam Anxiety Questionnaire, or EAQ). This scale produced a measure of anxiety scored out of 100. Anxiety was measured before an exam, and the percentage mark of each student on the exam was used to assess the exam performance. She also measured the number of hours spent revising.</p>

<p>Note there are five variables: the participant <strong>id</strong>, the hours spent revising (<strong>revise</strong>), their <strong>exam_grade</strong>, their exam <strong>anxiety</strong>, and their biological <strong>sex</strong>. We can visualise the data easily using the <code>GGally</code> package. When you want to plot continuous variables, the <code>ggscatmat()</code> function from this package produces a matrix of scatterplots (below the diagonal), distributions (along the diagonal) and the correlation coefficient (above the diagonal).</p>

<pre class="r"><code>GGally::ggscatmat(my_tibble, columns = c(&quot;variable 1&quot;, &quot; variable 2&quot;, &quot; variable 3&quot; …))</code></pre>

<p>The resulting plot shows that all of the variables are skewed. This skew could be a problem if we want to do significance tests or look at confidence intervals. The sample contains 103 observations, which is reasonably large, and possibly large enough for the central limit theorem to relieve of us of concerns about normality. We should consider using a robust method to compute the correlation coefficient itself.</p>

<p>The <code>correlation()</code> function takes the general form:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>correlation::correlation(tibble,
                         method = &quot;pearson&quot;,
                         p_adjust = &quot;holm&quot;,
                         ci = 0.95
                         )</code></pre>
<p>I’ve listed the main arguments, but there are others. For now, we’ll just look at the main arguments that we will use:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="alt">tibble</span>. This word should be replaced with the name of the tibble containing any variables that you wish to correlate.</li>
<li><span class="alt">method</span>. This argument sets the method for the correlation coefficient. By default it is set to <span class="alt">pearson</span> (to calculate Pearson’s coefficient) but can be changed to <span class="alt">spearman</span>, <span class="alt">kendall</span>, <span class="alt">biserial</span>, <span class="alt">polychoric</span>, <span class="alt">tetrachoric</span>, and <span class="alt">percentage</span> (for the percentage bend correlation) amongst others. We’ll look at some, but not all of these methods.</li>
<li><span class="alt">p_adjust</span>. By default the function corrects the <em>p</em>-value for the number of tests you have performed (a good idea) using the Holm-Bonferroni method, which applies the Bonferroni criterion in a slightly less strict way that controls the Type I error rate but with less risk of a Type II error. You can change this argument to <span class="alt">none</span> (i.e. don’t correct for multiple tests, a bad idea), <span class="alt">bonferroni</span> (to apply the standard Bonferroni method) or several other methods.</li>
<li><span class="alt">ci</span>. This argument sets the confidence interval width. By default it is 0.95 for a 95% confidence interval, which will probably be what you’ll generally use.</li>
</ul>
<p>To use the function, take your tibble, pipe it into the <code>select()</code> function from <code>dplyr</code> to select the variables you want to correlate, then pipe that into the correlation function. You can use the same code structure whether you want to correlate two variables or produce all correlations between pairs of multiple variables.</p>

<p>The resulting output tells us that exam grade has a correlation with revision of <span class="math inline">\(r = 0.40\)</span>, and a similar strength relationship with exam anxiety, <span class="math inline">\(r = -0.44\)</span> (but in the opposite direction). As revision increases so does exam performance, but as anxiety increase exam performance decreases. We also see that revision has a very strong negative relationship with exam anxiety, <span class="math inline">\(r = -0.71\)</span>. The more you revise the less anxiety you have about the exam. All <em>p</em>-values are less than 0.001 (and, so also less than 0.05) and would be interpreted as the correlation coefficients being significantly different from zero. The significance values tell us that the probability of getting correlation coefficients at least this big as these in a sample of 103 people if the null hypothesis were true (there was no relationship between these variables) is very low (close to zero in fact). If we’re prepared to assume that the sample is one of the 95% of samples that will produce a confidence interval containing the population value, then the confidence intervals tell us about the uncertainty around the value of <em>r</em>. For example, under this assumption, the population value of the association between exam grade and revision falls between 0.22 and 0.55.</p>

<p>Spearman correlations are very easy once you’ve mastered <code>correlation()</code>. Let’s switch example. Imagine I wanted to test a theory that more creative people will be better liars. I gathered together 68 past contestants from the World’s Biggest Liar competition (held annually at the Santon Bridge Inn in Wasdale in case you’re interested) and noted where they were placed in the competition (first, second, third, etc.); I also gave them a creativity questionnaire (maximum score 60). The position in the competition is an ordinal variable because the places are categories but have a meaningful order (first place is better than second place and so on). Therefore, Spearman’s correlation coefficient should be used (Pearson’s <em>r</em> requires interval or ratio data). The data for this study are preloaded in this tutorial in a tibble called <span class="alt">liar_tib</span>.

There was a significant negative relationship between creativity scores and how well someone did in the World’s Biggest Liar competition: as creativity increased, position decreased. This might seem contrary to what we predicted until you remember that a low number means that you did well in the competition (a low number such as 1 means you came first, and a high number like 4 means you came fourth). Therefore, our hypothesis is supported: as creativity increased, so did success in the competition.</p>

<p><strong>A message from Mae Jemstone:</strong></p>
<p>Once when I was travelling through the constellation of <em>dragonis murralis</em> on our mission to improve statistical literacy, we crunched some data and discovered that high anxiety is often associated with poorer performance in Mathematical subjects. It’s not that anxious people are less able, but their anxiety is a barrier that makes them feel that they can’t do things, even though they can. Associations like this are helpful to get us thinking about relationships between variables, which is the first step towards predicting variables! You’ve taken that first step towards understanding how we use measured variables to predict what might happen. Well done!</p>
<p>And if you’re one of those anxious people, you are not alone, and you <em>can</em> do this. Think about ways that you can feel the anxious feelings but not let them disrupt your thinking: when you feel the anxiety take some controlled, deep breaths for a minute. Be mindful. Believe in yourself, because I do.</p>
