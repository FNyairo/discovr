Once you have been at space pirate academy for a while, you get your own funky visor. It has various modes. My favourite is the one that allows you to see everything as a large plate of tuna. More important, sections marked for cat-dets with visors goes beyond the core material but is still important and should be studied by all cat-dets. However, try not to be disheartened if you find it difficult. For accessibility, these sections will also be labelled with (2).</li>

Those almost as brilliant as Mae (because no-one is quite as brilliant as her) get their own space suits so that they can go on space pirate adventures. They get to shout <em>RRRRRR</em> really loudly too. Actually, everyone here gets to should <em>RRRRRR</em> really loudly. Try it now. Go on. It feels good. Anyway, this material is the most advanced and you can consider it optional unless you are a postgraduate cat-det. For accessibility, these sections will also be labelled with (3).</li>

For example, if I want to use the <code>mutate()</code> function from the package <code>dplyr</code>, I will write <code>dplyr::mutate()</code>.</p>
<p>It is good practice to be explicit about packages to avoid clashes where functions from different packages have the same name. It also means that you don’t need to load packages at the start of your markdown document.</p>
<p>There are two main exceptions to this rule.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>There are functions within some <code>tidyverse</code> packages that would be used within other functions. Including the package name makes the code difficult to read. Also, no-one wants to write <code>ggplot2::</code> before every function from <code>ggplot2</code>.</li>
<li>To use the pipe operator (<code>%&gt;%</code>) you need to have <code>magrittr</code> loaded.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can load all of the packages that are exceptions in one step by loading <code>tidyverse</code> at the beginning of our <svg style="height: 1em; top:.04em; position: relative; fill: #136CB9;" viewBox="0 0 581 512"><path d="M581 226.6C581 119.1 450.9 32 290.5 32S0 119.1 0 226.6C0 322.4 103.3 402 239.4 418.1V480h99.1v-61.5c24.3-2.7 47.6-7.4 69.4-13.9L448 480h112l-67.4-113.7c54.5-35.4 88.4-84.9 88.4-139.7zm-466.8 14.5c0-73.5 98.9-133 220.8-133s211.9 40.7 211.9 133c0 50.1-26.5 85-70.3 106.4-2.4-1.6-4.7-2.9-6.4-3.7-10.2-5.2-27.8-10.5-27.8-10.5s86.6-6.4 86.6-92.7-90.6-87.9-90.6-87.9h-199V361c-74.1-21.5-125.2-67.1-125.2-119.9zm225.1 38.3v-55.6c57.8 0 87.8-6.8 87.8 27.3 0 36.5-38.2 28.3-87.8 28.3zm-.9 72.5H365c10.8 0 18.9 11.7 24 19.2-16.1 1.9-33 2.8-50.6 2.9v-22.1z"/></svg> Markdown document:</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows the general process of fitting linear model. First, we should produce scatterplots to get some idea of whether the assumption of linearity is met, and to look for outliers or obvious unusual cases. Having done this initial screen for problems we fit a model and save the various diagnostic statistics that we discuss later. If we want to generalize our model beyond the sample, or we are interested in interpreting significance tests and confidence intervals then we examine these residuals to check for homoscedasticity, normality, independence and linearity. If we find problems then we take corrective action, which involves fitting a different model. If the problem is lack of linearity then we fit a non-linear model, for lack of independent errors we’d use a multilevel model, and in all other situations we fit a robust version of the model using either bootstrapping (small samples) or robust standard errors. This process might seem complex, but it’s not as bad as it seems.</p>

<p>This tutorial follows the example from <span class="citation">(Field 2021)</span> that looks at predicting physical, downloaded and streamed album sales (outcome variable) from various predictor variables. The data file has 200 rows, each one representing a different album. There are also several columns, one of which contains the sales (in thousands) of each album in the week after release (<strong>sales</strong>) and one containing the amount (in thousands of pounds/dollars/euro/whatever currency you use) spent promoting the album before release (<strong>adverts</strong>). The other columns represent how many times songs from the album were played on a prominent national radio station in the week before release (<strong>airplay</strong>), and the ‘look’ of the band out of 10 (<strong>image</strong>). The data are in a tibble called <span class="alt">album_tib</span>.</p>

<p>We can visualise the data easily using the <code>GGally</code> package. When you want to plot continuous variables, the <code>ggscatmat()</code> function from this package produces a matrix of scatterplots (below the diagonal), distributions (along the diagonal) and the correlation coefficient (above the diagonal). It takes the general form:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>GGally::ggscatmat(my_tibble, columns = c(&quot;variable 1&quot;, &quot; variable 2&quot;, &quot; variable 3&quot; …))</code></pre>

<p>It’s a good idea to list the outcome variable <em>last</em> because it means that this variable is always plotted on the <em>y</em>-axis (which is appropriate for an outcome) and the plots of each predictor against the outcome variable will be along the bottom row of the grid.</p>

<p>It’s as simple as that! Like other plots we have done, we can apply a theme (I like <code>theme_minimal()</code>) in the usual way. Using the code example above add a <code>ggplot2</code> theme and put into place the advice in the cat-det’s tip. :</p>

<p>Although the data are messy, the three predictors have reasonably linear relationships with the album sales and there are no obvious outliers (except maybe in the bottom left of the scatterplot with band image). Across the diagonal, we see the distributions of scores. Advertising is very skewed and airplay and sales look quite heavy-tailed.</p>
<p>We can use the correlations in the plot to get a sense of the relationships between predictors and the outcome. If we look only at the predictors (ignore album sales) then the highest correlation is between the ratings of the band’s image and the amount of airplay which is significant at the 0.01 level (<em>r</em> = 0.18). Focussing on the outcome variable, of all of the predictors, adverts and airplay correlate best with the outcome (<em>r</em>s = 0.58 and 0.6 respectively).</p>

<p>To begin with we will predict sales from advertising alone. The model we’re fitting is described by the following equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
Y_i &amp; = b_0 + b_1X_i+ \epsilon_i\\
\text{Sales}_i &amp; = b_0 + b_1\text{Advertising}_i+ \epsilon_i
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>It should be clear from the earlier plot (look at the scatterplot in the bottom left corner) and correlation that a positive relationship exists: the more money spent advertising an album, the more it is likely to sell. Of course there are some albums that sell well regardless of advertising (top left of scatterplot), but there are none that sell badly when advertising levels are high (bottom right of scatterplot).</p>

This function takes the general form:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_model &lt;- lm(outcome ~ predictor(s), data = tibble, na.action = an action)</code></pre>
<p>In which <span class="alt">my_model</span> is whatever name you choose to give to the model, <span class="alt">outcome</span> is the name of the outcome variable (in our example <strong>sales</strong>), and <span class="alt">predictor</span> is the name of the predictor variable (in our example <strong>adverts</strong>) or, as we shall see, is a list of variables separated by ‘+’ symbols. We can also specify a way to handle missing values and <span class="alt">tibble</span> is the name of the tibble containing the data (in our example <span class="alt">album_tib</span>).</p>
<p>The observant among you might notice that within the function we write a formula that specifies the model that we want to estimate. This formula maps directly to the equation for the model. In this example <span class="alt">adverts ~ sales</span> maps onto <span class="math inline">\(\text{Sales}_i = b_0 + b_1\text{Advertising}_i+ \epsilon_i\)</span> except that we ignore the error term (<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span>) and parameter estimates (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>s) and we replace the equals sign with a tilde (<span class="alt">~</span>), which you can think of meaning ‘predicted from’.</p>

<p>Yuk! That output looks pretty horrible, doesn’t it? If you like tidier output, the <code>broom</code> package comes in handy. This package has functions that extract the key information from models, place this information in a tibble, and print it in a nice table. It has two main functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>glance()</code> function extracts the overall model fit statistics.</li>
<li>The <code>tidy()</code> function extracts the model parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>For both functions you simply place the model name into the function, like we did for <code>summary()</code>. Let’s look at these functions now.</p>

<p>It also reports an <em>F</em>-statistic (labelled <strong>statistic</strong>) and its <em>p</em>-value (labelled (<strong>p.value</strong>). Output 8.9 shows the results of this comparison. Note that the value of <em>F</em> is 99.58 and the value in column labelled <strong>p.value</strong> is <span class="alt">2.94198e-19</span>. I explain this notation a bit later, for now trust me that it means 2.94 with the decimal place moved 19 places to the left, or a very small value indeed. The degrees of freedom for this <em>F</em> are 2 (as shown in the variable <strong>df</strong>) and 198 (as shown in the variable <strong>res.d</strong>). Therefore, we can say that adding the predictor of <strong>advertising</strong> significantly improved the fit of the model to the data compared to having no predictors in the model, <em>F</em>(2, 198) = 99.58, <em>p</em> &lt; .001. In other words, adding advertising as a predictor significantly improved the model fit.</p>

<p>To see the model parameters we can use <code>broom::tidy()</code>, which takes the general form</p>
<pre class="r"><code>broom::tidy(model_name, conf.int = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)</code></pre>
<p>Basically, we put the model name into the function, then there are two main optional arguments. By default, the output does not include confidence intervals, so if you want them (hint: you do!) you’d override the default of <span class="alt">conf.int = FALSE</span> by changing it to <span class="alt">conf.int = TRUE</span>. By default you’ll get 95% confidence intervals, which you can override by setting <span class="alt">conf.level</span> to a different value from the default of 0.95 (e.g., <span class="alt">conf.level = 0.99</span> will give you 99% confidence intervals). You usually would leave the confidence level at 95%.</p>

<p>To get the model parameters with 95% confidence intervals we could execute:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="album_lm_tidy" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="2">
<pre class="text"><code>broom::tidy(album_lm, conf.int = TRUE)</code></pre>

</div>
<p>The output provides estimates of the model parameters (the <em>b</em>-values) and the significance of these values. The <em>Y</em> intercept (<span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span>) is 134.14. This value can be interpreted as meaning that when no money is spent on advertising (when <em>X</em> = 0), the model predicts that 134,140 albums will be sold (remember that our unit of measurement is thousands of albums). The value of <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> is 0.096. This value represents the change in the outcome associated with a unit change in the predictor. In other words, if our predictor variable is increased by one unit (if the advertising budget is increased by 1), then our model predicts that 0.096 extra albums will be sold. Our units of measurement were thousands of pounds and thousands of albums sold, so we can say that for an increase in advertising of £1000 the model predicts 96 (0.096 × 1000 = 96) extra album sales. This investment is pretty useless for the record company: it invests £1000 and gets only 96 extra sales! Fortunately, as we already know, advertising accounts for only one-third of the variance in album sales.</p>
<p>If a predictor is having a significant impact on our ability to predict the outcome then its <em>b</em> should be different from 0 (and large relative to its standard error). The <em>t</em>-test (labelled <strong>statistic</strong>) and associated <em>p</em>-value tell us whether the <em>b</em>-value is significantly different from 0. The column <strong>p.value</strong> contains the exact probability that a value of <em>t</em> at least as big as the one in the table would occur if the value of <em>b</em> in the population were zero. If this probability is less than 0.05, then people interpret that as the predictor being a ‘significant’ predictor of the outcome. For both <em>t</em>s, the probabilities are given in scientific notation. For example for the effect of adverts the <em>p</em> is 2.91e-19.</p>

<p>Scientific notation can seem confusing, but e-x is shorthand for <span class="math inline">\(\times 10^{-x}\)</span> and e+x is shorthand for <span class="math inline">\(\times 10^{x}\)</span>. Here’s two specific examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>2.91e-19 means <span class="math inline">\(2.91 \times 10^{-19}\)</span>, which in plain English means ’move the decimal place 19 places to the left. In other words, this number is 0.000000000000000000291. A very small number.</li>
<li>2.91e+19 means <span class="math inline">\(2.91 \times 10^{19}\)</span> or ’move the decimal place 19 places to the right. In other words, this number is 29100000000000000000. A very large number.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>With respect the values in the column <strong>p.value</strong>, it means that both values are zero to 3 decimal places (0.000), and so the probability of the <em>t</em> values (or larger) occurring if the values of <em>b</em> in the population were zero is less than 0.001. In other words, the <em>b</em>s are significantly different from 0. In the case of the <em>b</em> for advertising budget this result means that the advertising budget makes a significant contribution (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) to predicting album sales.</p>
<p>If our sample is one of the 95% producing confidence intervals that contain the population value then the confidence interval tells us that the population value of b for advertising budget is likely to fall between 0.077 and 0.115 and because this interval doesn’t include zero we might conclude that there is a genuine positive relationship between advertising budget and album sales in the population.</p>

<p>A bit of revision. Imagine that we collected 100 samples of data measuring the same variables as our current model. For each sample we estimate the same model that we have in this chapter, including confidence intervals for the unstandardized beta values. These boundaries are constructed such that in 95% of samples they contain the population value of <em>b</em>. Therefore, 95 of our 100 samples will yield confidence intervals for b that contain the population value. The trouble is that we don’t know if our sample is one of the 95% with confidence intervals containing the population values or one of the 5% that misses.</p>
<p>The typical pragmatic solution to this problem is to assume that your sample is one of the 95% that hits the population value. If you assume this, then you can reasonably interpret the confidence interval as providing information about the population value of <em>b</em>. A narrow confidence interval suggests that all samples would yield estimates of <em>b</em> that are fairly close to the population value, whereas wide intervals suggest a lot of uncertainty about what the population value of <em>b</em> might be. If the interval contains zero then it suggests that the population value of <em>b</em> might be zero – in other words, no relationship between that predictor and the outcome—and could be positive but might be negative. All of these statements are reasonable if you’re prepared to believe that your sample is one of the 95% for which the intervals contain the population value. Your belief will be wrong 5% of the time, though.</p>
<p>Looking at the 95% confidence interval for advertising (reproduced above), if our sample is one of the 95% producing confidence intervals that contain the population value then the confidence interval tells us that the population value of <em>b</em> for advertising budget is likely to fall between 0.077 and 0.115 and because this interval doesn’t include zero we might conclude that there is a genuine positive relationship between advertising budget and album sales in the population.</p>

<p>Let’s use the model to make some predictions. First, replace the <em>b</em>-values with the values from the output:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Sales}_i &amp; = b_0 + b_1\text{Advertising}_i+ \epsilon_i \\
\text{Sales}_i &amp; = 134.14 + (0.096\times\text{Advertising}_i)+ \epsilon_i \\
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>It is now possible to make a prediction about album sales, by replacing the advertising budget with a value of interest. For example, imagine a recording company executive wanted to spend £100,000 on advertising a new album. Remembering that our units are already in thousands of pounds, we can simply replace the advertising budget with 100. He would discover that album sales should be around 144,000 for the first week of sales:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Sales}_i &amp; = 134.14 + (0.096\times \text{Advertising}_i)+ \epsilon_i \\
\text{Sales}_i &amp; = 134.14 + (0.096\times \text{100})+ \epsilon_i \\
&amp;= 143.74
\end{aligned}

<p>Let’s extend the model to include airplay and the band’s image as additional predictors. The executive has past research indicating that advertising budget is a significant predictor of album sales, and so the new predictors (airplay and attract) should be entered into the model <em>after</em> advertising budget. This method is <em>hierarchical</em> (the researcher decides in which order to enter variables into the model based on past research). The model we’re fitting is described by the following equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
Y_i &amp; = b_0 + b_1X_{1i}+ b_2X_{2i} + \ldots + b_nX_{ni} + \epsilon_i\\
\text{Sales}_i &amp; = b_0 + b_1\text{Advertising}_i+ b_2\text{Airplay}_i + b_3\text{Image}_i + \epsilon_i
\end{aligned}

<p>We already have fitted a model predicting sales from advertising that is stored in <span class="alt">album_lm</span>. We’re now going to create a second model that builds upon this model by adding airplay and image as predictors. In other words, we’re building the model in the equation above.</p>
<p>To create this second model, we need to specify additional predictor variables in the same way that we add predictors to the equation itself: we use ‘+’ to add them into the model. So we change the formula within <code>lm()</code> from <span class="alt">sales ~ adverts</span> to <span class="alt">sales ~ adverts + airplay + image</span>. Note that the formula we use within <code>lm()</code> maps directly to the equation for the model but excludes the <em>b</em>s and the error term.</p>

<p>As before, the variable <strong>r.square</strong> tells us the value of <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>. Remember that for the first model its value was 0.335, which we interpreted as advertising budget accounting for 33.5% of the variation in album sales. When the two new predictors are included, this value increases to 0.665 or 66.5% of the variance in album sales. If advertising accounts for 33.5%, then the change in <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(R^2_\text{change} = 0.665 - 0.335 = 0.33\)</span>. In other words, image and airplay account for an additional 33% of the variance in sales.</p>
<p>The adjusted <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> (adj.r.squared) gives us some idea of how well our model generalizes and ideally we’d like its value to be the same as, or very close to, the value of <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>. In this example the difference for the final model is small (it is 0.665 − 0.660 = 0.005 or about 0.5%). This shrinkage means that if the model were derived from the population rather than a sample we’d conclude that it accounted for approximately 0.5% less variance in the outcome.</p>

<p>The variable <strong>statistic</strong> contains the <em>F</em>-statistic. The <em>F</em>-statistic represents the ratio of the improvement in prediction that results from fitting the model, relative to the inaccuracy that still exists in the model. The variable <strong>p.value</strong> contains the <em>p</em>-value associated with <em>F</em>, which in this case is <span class="math inline">\(2.88 \times 10^{-46}\)</span>, in other words a lot smaller than 0.001. The degrees of freedom for the <em>F</em>-statistic are (in terms of these variables) <strong>df</strong>−1 and <strong>df.residual</strong>, so we could report <em>F</em>(3, 196) = 129.50, <em>p</em> &lt; .001. We can interpret this result as meaning that the model significantly improves our ability to predict the outcome variable compared to not fitting the model.</p>

<p>The value of <em>F</em> is 96.45 (<strong>statistic</strong>) and the corresponding <em>p</em> (<strong>p.value</strong>) is <span class="alt">6.88e-30</span> (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(6.88 \times 10^{-30}\)</span>). The degrees of freedom for this <em>F</em> are the difference in the degrees of freedom between the two models (in this case 2 as shown in the variable <strong>df</strong>) and the degrees of freedom for the newer model (in this case 196 as shown in the variable <strong>res.df</strong>). Therefore, we can say that adding the predictors of image and airplay (<span class="alt">album_full_lm</span>) significantly improved the fit of the model to the data compared to having only advertising as a predictor (<span class="alt">album_lm</span>), <em>F</em>(2, 196) = 96.45, <em>p</em> &lt; .001.

<p>The output gives us estimates for the <em>b</em>-values (column labelled <strong>estimate</strong>) and statistics that indicate the individual contribution of each predictor to the model. The <em>b</em>-values can be used to interpret the relationship between album sales and each predictor. All three predictors have positive <em>b</em>-values indicating positive relationships. So, as advertising budget increases, album sales increase; as plays on the radio increase, so do album sales; and finally more attractive bands will sell more albums. The <em>b</em>-values tell us more than this, though. They tell us to what degree each predictor affects the outcome if the effects of all other predictors are held constant.</p>

<p>We’ve looked at the band’s image, but for the other two predictors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertising budget: <em>b</em> = 0.085 indicates that as advertising budget increases by one unit, album sales increase by 0.085 units. Both variables were measured in thousands; therefore, for every £1000 more spent on advertising, an extra 0.085 thousand albums (85 albums) are sold. This interpretation is true only if the effects of band image and airplay are held constant.</li>
<li>Airplay: <em>b</em> = 3.367 indicates that as the number of plays on radio in the week before release increases by one, album sales increase by 3.367 units. Every additional play of a song on radio (in the week before release) is associated with an extra 3.367 thousand albums (3367 albums) being sold. This interpretation is true only if the effects of the band’s image and advertising budget are held constant.</li>

<pre class="r"><code>parameters::model_parameters(my_model, standardize = NULL, digits = 2)</code></pre>
<p>To get standardized <em>b</em>s we need to change the <em>standardize</em> argument from its default value of <em>NULL</em> to <em>“refit”</em>. The argument <em>digits</em> determines how many decimal places are printed. The default is 2, but we’ll change it to 3 because I like to live life on the edge.</p>

<p>Let’s summarize the values for the remaining predictors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertising budget: Standardized <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = 0.511 indicates that as advertising budget increases by one standard deviation (£485,655), album sales increase by 0.511 standard deviations. The standard deviation for album sales is 80,699, so this constitutes a change of 41,240 sales (0.511 × 80,699). Therefore, for every £485,655 more spent on advertising, an extra 41,240 albums are sold. This interpretation is true only if the effects of the band’s image and airplay are held constant.</li>
<li>Image: Standardized <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = 0.192 indicates that a band rated one standard deviation (1.40 units) higher on the image scale can expect additional album sales of 0.192 standard deviations units. This is a change of 15,490 sales (0.192 × 80,699). A band with an image rating 1.40 higher than another band can expect 15,490 additional sales. This interpretation is true only if the effects of airplay and advertising are held constant.</li>
</ul>

<p>The quiz told you about the confidence interval for airplay, for the remaining predictors the confidence intervals tell us that <strong>assuming that each confidence interval is one of the 95% that contains the population parameter</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The true size of the relationship between advertising budget and album sales lies somewhere between 0.071 and 0.099.</li>
<li>The true size of the relationship between band image and album sales lies somewhere between 6.28 and 15.89.</li>
</ul>
<p>The two best predictors (advertising and airplay) have very tight confidence intervals indicating that the estimates for the current model are likely to be representative of the true population values. The interval for the band’s image is wider (but still does not cross zero) indicating that the parameter for this variable is less representative, but nevertheless significant.</p>

<p>The output also contains the confidence intervals for each model parameter (<em>b</em>). The values in <strong>statistic</strong> are the values of <em>t</em> associated with each <em>b</em> and <strong>p.value</strong> is the associated significance of the <em>t</em>-statistic. For every predictor the <em>b</em> is significantly different from 0 (<em>p</em> &lt; .001), meaning that all predictors significantly predict album sales.</p>

<p>Many students and researchers think of <em>p</em>-values in terms of the ‘probability of a chance result’ or ‘the probability of a hypothesis being true’ but they are neither of these things. They are the long-run probability that you would get a test-statistic (in this case <em>t</em>) at least as large as the one you have if the null hypothesis were true. In other words, if there really were no relationship between advertising budget and album sales (the null hypothesis) then the population value of <em>b</em> would be zero. Imagine we sampled from this null population and computed <em>t</em>, and then repeated this process 1000 times. We’d have 1000 values of <em>t</em> from a population in which there was no effect. We could plot these values as a histogram. This would tell us how often certain values of <em>t</em> occur. From it we could work out the probability of getting a particular value of <em>t</em>. If we then took another sample, and computed <em>t</em> (because we’re kind of obsessed with this sort of thing) we would be able to compare this value of <em>t</em> to the distribution of all the previous 1000 samples. Is the <em>t</em> in our current sample large of small compared to the others? Let’s say it was larger than 999 of the previous values. That would be quite an unlikely value of <em>t</em> whereas if it was larger than 500 of them this would not surprise us. This is what a <em>p</em>-value is: it is the long run probability of getting test statistic at least as large as the one you have if the null hypothesis were true. If the value is less than 0.05, people typically take this as supporting the idea that the null hypothesis isn’t true.</p>
</div>
<p>The <em>p</em>-values in the table all tell us the long-run probability that we would get a a value of <em>t</em> at least as large as the ones we have if the the true relationship between each predictor and album sales was 0 (i.e., <em>b</em> = 0). In all cases the probabilities are less than 0.001, which researchers would generally take to mean that the observed <em>b</em>s are significantly different from zero. Given the <em>b</em>s quantify the relationship between each predictor and album sales, this conclusion implies that each predictor significantly predicts album sales.</p>

<p>This optional example is based on real research on suicide risk and can be skipped if these themes are likely to cause you distress.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="citation">(Lacourse, Claes, and Villeneuve 2001)</span> conducted a study to see whether suicide risk was related to listening to heavy metal music. They devised a scale to measure preference for bands falling into the category of heavy metal. This scale included heavy metal bands (Black Sabbath, <a href="https://ironmaiden.com/">Iron Maiden</a>), speed metal bands (<a href="https://www.slayer.net/">Slayer</a>, <a href="https://www.metallica.com/">Metallica</a>), death/black metal bands (Obituary, Burzum) and gothic bands (Marilyn Manson, Sisters of Mercy). They then used this (and other variables) as predictors of suicide risk based on a scale measuring suicidal ideation etc.</p>
<p>Data are in the tibble <span class="alt">metal_tib</span> are from a fictitious replication. There are two variables representing scores on the scales described above: <strong>hm</strong> (the extent to which the person listens to heavy metal music) and <strong>suicide</strong> (the extent to which someone has suicidal ideation and so on).</p>

<p>This optional example discusses anxiety disorders and can be skipped if these themes are likely to cause you distress.</p>
</div>
<p>In this example we’ll look at data collected from several questionnaires relating to clinical psychology, and we will use these measures to predict social anxiety. Anxiety disorders take on different shapes and forms, and each disorder is believed to be distinct and have unique causes. We can summarize the disorders and some popular theories as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social Anxiety: Social anxiety disorder is a marked and persistent fear of 1 or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or possible scrutiny by others. This anxiety leads to avoidance of these situations. People with social phobia are believed to feel elevated feelings of shame.</li>
<li>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD): OCD is characterized by the everyday intrusion into conscious thinking of intense, repetitive, personally abhorrent, absurd and alien thoughts (Obsessions), leading to the endless repetition of specific acts or to the rehearsal of bizarre and irrational mental and behavioural rituals (compulsions).</li>
</ul>
<p>Social anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder are seen as distinct disorders having different causes. However, there are some similarities. They both involve some kind of attentional bias: attention to bodily sensation in social anxiety and attention to things that could have negative consequences in OCD. They both involve repetitive thinking styles: social phobics ruminate about social encounters after the event (known as post-event processing), and people with OCD have recurring intrusive thoughts and images. They both involve safety behaviours (i.e. trying to avoid the thing that makes you anxious).</p>
<p>This might lead us to think that, rather than being different disorders, they are manifestations of the same core processes <span class="citation">(Field and Cartwright-Hatton 2008)</span>. One way to research this possibility would be to see whether social anxiety can be predicted from measures of other anxiety disorders. If social anxiety disorder and OCD are distinct we should expect that measures of OCD will not predict social anxiety. However, if there are core processes underlying all anxiety disorders, then measures of OCD should predict social anxiety. The data are in <span class="alt">soc_anx_tib</span>. This tibble contains three variables of interest to us:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>spai</strong>: The Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI), which measures levels of social anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>obq</strong>: Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ), which measures the degree to which people experience obsessive beliefs like those found in OCD.</li>
<li><strong>tosca</strong>: The Test of Self-Conscious Affect (TOSCA), which measures shame.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of 134 people was administered all questionnaires. Fit a hierarchical linear model with two blocks:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Block 1: the first block (call it <span class="alt">soc_anx_lm</span>) will contain any predictors that we expect to predict social anxiety. In this example we have only one variable that we expect, theoretically, to predict social anxiety and that is shame (measured by the TOSCA).</li>
<li>Block 2: the second block (call it <span class="alt">soc_anx_obq_lm</span>) adds OBQ, the predictor variable that we don’t necessarily expect to predict social anxiety.</li>
</ol>

<p>In this section we look at whether the model we have just fitted is biased. First, let’s see whether you understood book chapter/lecture with a quiz, because everyone loves a quiz. Or is that chocolate? “Everyone loves chocolate?” does <em>sound</em> plausible, but I get so confused between the two. No, I’m pretty sure it’s quizzes that people love, not chocolate, so here goes:</p>

<p>We can use the <code>plot()</code> function to produce diagnostic plots from the model, which takes the general form:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(my_model, which = numbers_of_the_plots_you_want)</code></pre>
<p>In other words, you place the name of your model into the function and use which if you want to override the default plots (more on that in a minute).</p>

<li>A Q-Q plot of the standardized residuals. Use this plot to look for normality of residuals.</li>
<li>The predicted values from the model (<em>x</em>-axis) against the square root of the standardized residuals (<em>y</em>-axis). This is a variant of plot 1 and is used to look for linearity and homoscedasticity.</li>
<li>The case number (<em>x</em>-axis) against the Cook’s distance (<em>y</em>-axis). This plot can help to identify influential cases (cases with large values for Cook’s distance).</li>

<p>We use residual plots (plots 1 and 3) to look for linearity and homoscedasticity. The Figure below (taken from <span class="citation">(Field 2021)</span>) shows that we’re looking for a random scatter of dots. Curvature in the plot indicates a lack of linearity, and a funnel shape (residuals that ‘fan out’) indicates heteroscedasticity. Curvature <em>and</em> a funnel shape indicates both non-linearity and heteroscedasticity. We can also use Q-Q plots to look for normality in residuals.</p>

<p>Both plots can be interpreted in the same way: if the assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity are met then this graph should look like a random array of dots and the red trend line should be flat. The scale-location plot (right) tends to be more sensitive to violations of assumptions and so they are easier to spot on this plot.</p>

<p>Add a <code>ggplot2</code> element to this plot in the usual way with the <code>+</code> symbol. For example, to apply my ever-favourite <code>theme_minimal()</code> we could use:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="ce_resid_pred_fortify2" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="2">
<pre class="text"><code>ggplot2::autoplot(album_full_lm, which = 1) +

</div>
<p><code>ggfortify</code> also adds some useful arguments to <code>autoplot()</code> that map onto aesthetics that we have met in earlier tutorials. As with any <code>ggplot2</code> plot we can change colours using <a href="https://www.color-hex.com/">hex codes</a>. Here’s some properties that we can change within <code>autoplot()</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="alt">colour</span>. Sets the colour of the points on the plot.</li>
<li><span class="alt">smooth</span>.colour*. Set the colour of the trend line on the plots.</li>
<li><span class="alt">size</span>. Sets the size of the dots on the plot.</li>
<li><span class="alt">alpha</span>. Sets the transparency of the points on the plot (0 = invisible, 1 = solid)</li>
</ul>

<p>A quick way to check for influential cases is to inspect the influence plots for the model, which we can obtain by selecting plots 4 to 6 from the <code>plot()</code> function (described earlier). Use what you have learnt to create this plot. If you completed the optional section on <em>Pretty residual plots</em> try applying the code in that section to produce prettier versions of the influence plots.</p>

<p>The first plot shows the value of Cook’s distance for each case and labels cases with the largest values (cases 1, 164 and 169). Looking at the y-axis it’s easy to see that the largest values are in the region of 0.06, which is well below the threshold of 1. The second plot shows leverage values plotted against standardized residuals. We want the trend line (the solid red line) to be flat and lie along the zero, which is what we see in this plot. If the red line deviates substantially from the horizontal then it can indicate that one of the assumptions of the model has been violated. This plot also usually has red dashed lines indicating values of Cook’s distance of 0.5 and 1. Notice that our plot has no dashed red lines, which is because all values of Cook’s distance are well below these thresholds. The final plot shows leverage, Cook’s distance and the standardized residual for each case on the same plot. It can be used to identify cases that have high leverage, high Cook’s distance, large residual or some combination of the three. For example, case 164 has a standardized residual between 2.5 and 3, the largest Cook’s distance (although still only in the region of 0.06) and higher than average leverage (remember the average leverage for this model is 0.2, and the value for case 164 looks to be around 0.4).</p>

<p>For a more precise look, we can obtain values for Cooks distance and standardized residuals using <code>broom::augment()</code>. All we need to do is to pass our linear model object into this function and save the results as a new tibble.

<p>To save the a set of diagnostic statistics (including Cook’s value and standardized residuals) we create a new tibble called <span class="alt">album_full_rsd</span> (I tend to use the suffix _rsd, short for residuals) by piping our model (<span class="alt">album_full_lm</span>) into <code>broom::augment()</code> to get the residuals and then into <code>tibble::rowid_to_column()</code> to create a variable that contains the row number. The <em>var = “case_no”</em> tells the function to name the variable containing the row numbers <strong>case_no</strong> (choose a different name if you like). The result is a tibble called <span class="alt">album_full_rsd</span> that contains the case number, the original data to which the model was fitted, and various diagnostic statistics.</p>

<p>If you have missing values in the data and used <span class="alt">na.action = na.exclude</span> when fitting the model, you must also tell <code>augment()</code> where to find the original data so that it can map the residuals to the original cases. In this example, had we had missing values we would have used:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>album_full_rsd &lt;- broom::augment(album_full_lm, data = album_tib)</code></pre>
<p>Or in a pipe:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>album_full_rsd &lt;- album_full_lm %&gt;% 
  broom::augment(., data = album_tib)</code></pre>
<p>If you get an error when trying to get a tibble of residuals using <code>augment()</code>, then think about whether you have missing values and remember this tip!</p>

<p>To see what percentage of standardized residuals fall outside of these limits we can simply filter the tibble containing the residuals such that we see only cases with a standardized residual that is less than −1.96 or greater than 1.96. To simplify this task we can use the <code>abs()</code> function within the filter to return the absolute value (ignores the plus or minus sign) of the residual. Doing so means that we can simply filter by values above 1.96 (or whatever threshold we want to use). This won’t change the value of the residual itself because it’s being applied within the filter. Here’s some code (the last two lines are optional), which is explained below.</p>

<p>This code takes the tibble of residuals and pipes it into <code>filter()</code> where we set the criteria that the absolute value of the variable <strong>.std.resid</strong> must be greater or equal to 1.96 (that’s what <code>abs(.std.resid) &gt;= 1.96</code> does). To make the output more focussed we can (but don’t have to) pipe the filtered tibble into <code>select()</code> and select only the case number, the standardized residual and the raw residual. Finally (and optionally) we pipe the tibble into <code>arrange()</code> to sort it by the size of <strong>.std.resid</strong>, so that the resulting table will list cases from the smallest standardized residual to the largest.</p>

<p>We can do something similar to look at Cook’s distance. We could either filter the tibble to look at cases with Cook’s distance greater than 1, or simply sort the tibble in descending order using <code>arrange()</code> which will show us the cases with the largest Cook’s distances. Again, we could use <code>select()</code> so that we see only the Cook’s values and case numbers.</p>

<p>Our model appears, in most senses, to be both accurate for the sample and generalizable to the population. Sometimes this won’t be the case. There are two things we might want to do: (1) test whether the parameter estimates have been biased, and (2) check whether confidence intervals and significance tests have been biased.</p>

<p>To check the parameter estimates we can fit a robust model using the <code>robust::lmRob()</code> function. This function is used in the same way as <code>lm()</code>, so to get a robust version of our final model we can simply replace <code>lm()</code> with <code>lmRob()</code> in our earlier code.

<p>The bottom of the output shows significance tests of bias. With the usual caveats about significance tests needing to be interpreted within the context of the sample size, these tests suggest that bias in the original model is not problematic (because the <em>p</em>-value for these tests are not significant). Mainly we want to compare the robust parameter estimates to the original ones. For adverts the original <em>b</em> was 0.085 and the robust estimate is the same, for airplay the original <em>b</em> was 3.37 and the robust one is 3.42 and for image the original <em>b</em> was 11.09 and the robust estimate is 11.77. In short, the robust estimates are virtually identical to the originals suggesting the original model is unbiased.</p>

<p>To test whether confidence intervals and significance tests are biased we can estimate the model with standard errors designed for heteroscedastic residuals or if the sample size is small use a bootstrap. We can do both of these by placing the model in the <code>parameters::model_parameters()</code> function. You might recall that we used this function to standardize the parameter estimates. There are three arguments in this function that we didn’t explore before that we’ll look at now.</p>

<p>We can obtain models based on robust standard errors by setting <em>robust = TRUE</em> and using the argument <em>vcov.type</em> to set which method to use. If we omit the argument it defaults to “HC3” (which is fine), but we can change it to “HC4” (which some consider better). This code makes our model robust by implementing HC4 standard errors.</p>

<p>The output shows the resulting <em>b</em>-values, their robust standard errors, confidence intervals and <em>p</em>-values. Compare these with the non-robust versions from earlier. The values are not much different (mainly because our original model didn’t seem to violate its assumptions); for example, the standard error for the <em>b</em> for image has changed from 2.44 to 2.25, the associated <em>t</em>-statistic has changed from 4.55 to 4.93, and the confidence interval has changed from [6.28, 15.89] to [6.65, 15.52]. These changes are not dramatic, our interpretation of the model won’t have changed. Nevertheless, this is a useful sensitivity analysis in that if a robust model yields basically the same values as the non-robust model then we know that the non-robust model has not been unduly biased. If the robust estimates are hugely different from the original estimates then use and report the robust versions. Fitting a robust model is a win-win.</p>

<p>In small samples we might prefer to bootstrap the confidence intervals. We can do this by setting the bootstrap argument within <code>model_parameters()</code> to TRUE. By default, 1000 bootstrap samples are used, which is fine for most purposes. Therefore, we can bootstrap the model album_full_lm by executing:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="album_boot" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="1">

</div>
<p>These bootstrap confidence intervals and significance values do not rely on assumptions of normality or homoscedasticity, so they give us an accurate estimate of the population value of <em>b</em> for each predictor (assuming our sample is one of the 95% with confidence intervals that contain the population value).

<p>Because bootstrapping relies on random sampling from the data you will get slightly different estimates each time you bootstrap a model. This behaviour is normal and nothing to worry about.</p>

<p>Following on from the earlier unguided example about predicting social anxiety. To recap, the data are in the tibble <span class="alt">soc_anx_tib</span>, which contains three variables of interest to us:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>spai</strong>: The Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI), which measures levels of social anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>obq</strong>: Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ), which measures the degree to which people experience obsessive beliefs like those found in OCD.</li>
<li><strong>tosca</strong>: The Test of Self-Conscious Affect (TOSCA), which measures shame.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the previous unguided example, we fit a linear model that predicted social anxiety from shame (measured by the TOSCA) and obsessive beliefs (measured by OBQ). This model was stored as <span class="alt">soc_anx_obq_lm</span>.</p>

<p><strong>A message from Mae Jemstone:</strong></p>
<p>You have just completed probably the most important tutorial because it lays the foundations for fitting predictive models. Scientists, businesses, sports teams, government bodies and pretty much anyone else using statistical methods wants to predict things. Will this treatment work? How many goals will this player score if we buy her? Will changing the packaging increase sales? Will investing in start-up loans for companies reduce unemployment? Will buying a sonic screwdriver make me the most badass pirate in the galaxy? These are all questions where someone is trying to predict something from a set of other variables, apart from the last one because the answer to that is know because I’m <em>already</em> the most badass pirate in the galaxy. In the media, and possibly your jobs, you will be bombarded with information from predictive models. You now have the power to understand these models, evaluate their reliability, and make your own assessments of them. Good for you! Until the next time …</p>

Without Allison, these tutorials would look a lot worse (but she can’t be blamed for my colour scheme).</p>
