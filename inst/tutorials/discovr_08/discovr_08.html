<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This tutorial is one of a series that accompanies <a href="https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/books/discovering-statistics-using-r/">Discovering Statistics Using R and RStudio</a> <span class="citation">(Field 2020)</span> by me, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Field_(academic)">Andy Field</a>.

<ul>
<li>Who is the tutorial aimed at?
<ul>
<li>Anyone teaching from or reading <a href="https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/books/discovering-statistics-using-r/">Discovering Statistics Using R and RStudio</a> may find them useful.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is covered?
<ul>
<li>This tutorial looks at some key concepts in using <strong>R</strong> and <strong>RStudio</strong>. It would be a useful tutorial to run at the start of a module, or alongside teaching based on Chapter 1 of <a href="https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/books/discovering-statistics-using-r/">Discovering Statistics Using R and RStudio</a>.</li>
<li>This tutorial <em>does not</em> teach the background theory: it is assumed you have either attended my lecture or read the relevant chapter in the aforementioned book (or someone else’s)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven’t done so already, I recommend working through <a href="http://milton-the-cat.rocks/learnr/r/r_getting_started/">this tutorial</a> on how to install, set up and work within R and RStudio before starting this tutorial.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-packages-and-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Packages and data</h2>
<p>The tutorials are self-contained (you practice code in code boxes) so you don’t need to use RStudio at the same time. However, I recommend that you open another RStudio session to the one that you’re using to run this tutorial. In this second RStudio session, open an R markdown file and practice everything you do in the tutorial in the R markdown file (and save it). This video explains the sort of workflow that I mean:</p>
<p><img src="%22https://youtu.be/FE0ntX0dyc4%22" /></p>
<p><font color='#E69F00'>Within the tutorial itself, everything will work. To replicate things outside of the tutorial you will need to load the relevant packages and data.</font></p>
<div id="section-packages" class="section level3">
<h3>Packages</h3>
<p>To work <em>outside of this tutorial</em> you need to load the following packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>broom</code> <span class="citation">(Robinson and Hayes 2019)</span></li>
<li><code>GGally</code> <span class="citation">(Schloerke et al. 2018)</span></li>
<li><code>here</code> <span class="citation">(Müller 2017)</span></li>
<li><code>lm.beta</code> <span class="citation">(Behrendt 2014)</span></li>
<li><code>tidyverse</code> <span class="citation">(Wickham 2017)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven’t already done this, install a package at the command line using <code>install.packages("package_name")</code>, where <em>package_name</em> is the name of the package. If the package has already been installed, load it by typing <code>library(package_name)</code>, where <em>package_name</em> is the name of the package, within the first code chunk in your R markdown file.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>To work <em>outside of this tutorial</em> you need to download the following data files:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.discoveringstatistics.com/repository/discovr_data/album_sales.csv">album_sales.csv</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.discoveringstatistics.com/repository/discovr_data/metal_health.csv">metal_health.csv</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.discoveringstatistics.com/repository/discovr_data/social_anxiety.csv">social_anxiety.csv</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming you set up an RStudio project in the way that <a href="http://milton-the-cat.rocks/learnr/r/r_getting_started/#section-working-in-rstudio">I recommend in this tutorial</a>, then save the data files to the folder within your project folder called <code>data</code>. Then, in the first code chunk in your R Markdown document, execute:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>album_tib &lt;- here::here(&quot;data/album_sales.csv&quot;) %&gt;% readr::read_csv()
soc_anx_tib &lt;- here::here(&quot;data/social_anxiety.csv&quot;) %&gt;% readr::read_csv()

<div id="section-the-linear-model-process" class="section level2">
<h2>The linear model process</h2>
<p>Figure 1 shows a general procedure to follow when computing a bivariate correlation coefficient. First, check for sources of bias as outlined. The two most important ones in this context are linearity and normality. Remember that we’re fitting linear model to the data, so if the relationship between variables is not linear then this model is invalid. To meet this requirement, the outcome variable needs to be measured at the interval or ratio level as does the predictor variable (one exception is that a predictor variable can be a categorical variable with only two categories). As far as normality is concerned, we care about this only if we want confidence intervals or significance tests and if the sample size is small.</p>
<p>If the data have outliers, are not normal implying a non-normal sampling distribution (and the sample is small) or your variables are measured at the ordinal level then you can use Spearman’s rho or Kendall’s tau, which are versions of the correlation coefficient applied to ranked data. Ranking the data reduces the impact of outliers but we lose information so, we can instead fit a robust variant such as the percentile bend correlation or Winsorized correlation. Furthermore, given that normality of the sampling distribution matters only for inferring significance and computing confidence intervals in small samples, we could use a bootstrap to compute the confidence interval in small samples, then we don’t need to worry about this assumption.</p>

<div id="section-the-example" class="section level2">
<h2>The example</h2>
<p>This tutorial follows the example from <span class="citation">(Field 2020)</span> that looks at predicting physical, downloaded and streamed album sales (outcome variable) from various predictor variables. The data are in the file <a href="./www/album_sales.sav">album_sales.sav</a>. This data file has 200 rows, each one representing a different album. There are also several columns, one of which contains the sales (in thousands) of each album in the week after release (<strong>sales</strong>) and one containing the amount (in thousands of pounds/dollars/euro/whatever currency you use) spent promoting the album before release (<strong>adverts</strong>). The other columns represent how many times songs from the album were played on a prominent national radio station in the week before release (<strong>airplay</strong>), and the ‘look’ of the band out of 10 (<strong>image</strong>). The data are in a tibble called <code>album_tib</code>. Use the code box to look at the data.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="album_data" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="2">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":false,"error":false,"message":false,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="album_data-solution" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>album_tib</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Note how the data are laid out: each variable is in a column and each row represents a different album. So, the first album had £10,260 spent advertising it, sold 330,000 copies, received 43 plays on radio the week before release, and was made by a band with a pretty sick image (10 out of 10!).</p>
</div>
<div id="section-visualizing-the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Visualizing the data</h2>
<p>We can visualise the data easily using the <code>GGally</code> package. When you want to plot continuous variables, the <code>ggscatmat()</code> function from this package produces a matrix of scatterplots (below the diagonal), distributions (along the diagonal) and the correlation coefficient (above the diagonal). It takes the general form:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>GGally::ggscatmat(my_tibble, columns = c(&quot;variable 1&quot;, &quot; variable 2&quot;, &quot; variable 3&quot; …))</code></pre>
<p>Basically, you feed in the name of the tibble containing the variables, and use the columns argument to name the variables that you want to plot. For example, to plot all o fthe variables:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>GGally::ggscatmat(album_tib, columns = c(&quot;adverts&quot;, &quot;airplay&quot;, &quot;image&quot;, &quot;sales&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>It’s as simple as that! Like other plots we have done, we can also apply a theme (I like <code>theme_minimal()</code>) in the usual way:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>GGally::ggscatmat(album_tib, columns = c(&quot;adverts&quot;, &quot;airplay&quot;, &quot;image&quot;, &quot;sales&quot;)) +
  theme_minimal()</code></pre>
<p>Try this in the code box:</p>
<p><font color='#E69F00'>It’s a good idea to list the outcome variable last because it means that this variable is always plotted on the y-axis (which is appropriate for an outcome) and the plots of each predictor against the outcome variable will be along the bottom row of the grid.</font></p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="album_plot" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="2">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":false,"error":false,"message":false,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="album_plot-solution" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>GGally::ggscatmat(album_tib, columns = c(&quot;adverts&quot;, &quot;airplay&quot;, &quot;image&quot;, &quot;sales&quot;)) +
  theme_minimal()</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Although the data are messy, the three predictors have reasonably linear relationships with the album sales and there are no obvious outliers (except maybe in the bottom left of the scatterplot with band image). Across the diagonal, we see the distributions of scores. Advertising is very skewed and airplay and sales look quite heavy-tailed.</p>
<p>We can use the correlations in the plot to get a sense of the relationships between predictors and the outcome. If we look only at the predictors (ignore album sales) then the highest correlation is between the ratings of the band’s image and the amount of airplay which is significant at the 0.01 level (r = 0.18). Focussing on the outcome variable, of all of the predictors, adverts and airplay correlate best with the outcome (rs = 0.58 and 0.6 respectively).</p>
</div>
<div id="section-one-predictor" class="section level2">
<h2>One predictor</h2>
<div id="section-fitting-the-model" class="section level3">
<h3>Fitting the model</h3>
<p>To begin with we will predict sales from advertising alone. The model we’re fitting is described by the following equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
Y_i &amp; = b_0 + b_1X_i+ \epsilon_i\\
\text{Sales}_i &amp; = b_0 + b_1\text{Advertising}_i+ \epsilon_i
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>It should be clear from the earlier plot (look at the scatterplot in the bottom left corner) and correlation that a positive relationship exists: the more money spent advertising an album, the more it is likely to sell. Of course there are some albums that sell well regardless of advertising (top left of scatterplot), but there are none that sell badly when advertising levels are high (bottom right of scatterplot).</p>
<p>To fit a linear model in R we use the <code>lm()</code> function. This function takes the general form:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_model &lt;- lm(outcome ~ predictor(s), data = tibble, na.action = an action)</code></pre>
<p>In which <code>my_model</code> is whatever name you choose to give to the model, <code>outcome</code> is the name of the outcome variable (in our example <strong>sales</strong>), and <code>predictor</code> is the name of the predictor variable (in our example <strong>adverts</strong>) or, as we shall see, is a list of variables separated by ‘+’ symbols. We can also specify a way to handle missing values and <code>tibble</code> is the name of the tibble containing the data (in our example <code>album_tib</code>).</p>
<p>The observant among you might notice that within the function we write a formula that specifies the model that we want to estimate. This formula maps directly to the equation for the model. In this example <code>adverts ~ sales</code> maps onto <span class="math inline">\(\text{Sales}_i = b_0 + b_1\text{Advertising}_i+ \epsilon_i\)</span> except that we ignore the error term (<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span>) and parameter estimates (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>s) and we replace the equals sign with a tilde (~), which you can think of meaning ‘predicted from’.</p>
<p>We can, therefore, fit the model with</p>
<pre class="r"><code>album_lm &lt;- lm(sales ~ adverts, data = album_tib, na.action = na.exclude)</code></pre>
<p>In fact, because there are no missing data in the data the <code>na.action = na.exclude</code> is optional. We now have an object called <code>album_lm</code> that has the model stored, and we can extract information from it.</p>
<p><font color='#E69F00'>I tend to name linear models with the suffix _lm but you don’t have to share my obsession with using suffixes that tell me what the object contains</font></p>
<p>Try this in the code box below. Note nothing much happens. That’s because the model has been created and stored, but we haven’t asked R to show it to us. We’ll look at how to inspect the model next.</p>

<h3>Extracting model information with <code>summary()</code> and <code>broom</code></h3>
<p>There are different ways to inspect the model we have just fitted. The bread and butter way is to use the <code>summary()</code> function, into which we place the name of model that we just created (<code>album_lm</code>):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(album_lm)</code></pre>

<p>Looks pretty horrible doesn’t it? This is where the <code>broom</code> package comes in handy. This package has functions that extract the key information from models, place this information in a tibble, and print them in a nice table. It has two main functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>glance()</code> function extracts the overall model fit statistics.</li>
<li>The <code>tidy()</code> function extracts the model parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>For both functions you simply place the model name into the function.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-overall-model-fit" class="section level3">
<h3>Overall model fit</h3>
<p>To get overall model fit statistics execute:</p>

<p>It also reports an <em>F</em>-statistic (labelled <strong>statistic</strong>) and its <em>p</em>-value (labelled (<strong>p.value</strong>). Output 8.9 shows the results of this comparison. Note that the value of <em>F</em> is 99.58 and the value in column labelled <strong>p.value</strong> is <code>2.94198e-19</code>. I explain this notation a bit later, for now trust me that it means 2.94 with the decimal place moved 19 places to the left, or a very small value indeed. The degrees of freedom for this <em>F</em> are 2 (as shown in the variable <strong>df</strong>) and 198 (as shown in the variable <strong>res.d</strong>). Therefore, we can say that adding the predictor of <strong>advertising</strong> significantly improved the fit of the model to the data compared to having no predictors in the model, F(2, 198) = 99.58, p &lt; .001. In other words, adding advertising as a predictor significantly improved the model fit.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-model-parameters" class="section level3">
<h3>Model parameters</h3>
<p>To see the model parameters we can use <code>broom::tidy()</code>, which takes the general form</p>
<pre class="r"><code>broom::tidy(model_name, conf.int = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)</code></pre>
<p>Basically, we put the model name into the function, then there are two main optional arguments. By default, the output does not include confidence intervals, so if you want them (hint: you do!) you’d override the default of <code>conf.int = FALSE</code> by changing it to <code>conf.int = TRUE</code>. By default you’ll get 95% confidence intervals, which you can override by setting <code>conf.level</code> to a different value from the default of 0.95 (e.g., <code>conf.level = 0.99</code> will give you 99% confidence intervals). You usually would leave the confidence level at 95%. To get the model parameters with 95% confidence intervals we could, therefore, execute:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>broom::tidy(album_lm, conf.int = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Try this in the code box:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="album_lm_tidy" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="2">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":false,"error":false,"message":false,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.setup":"album_lm_setup","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="album_lm_tidy-solution" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>broom::tidy(album_lm, conf.int = TRUE)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The output provides estimates of the model parameters (the <em>b</em>-values) and the significance of these values. The <em>Y</em> intercept (<span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span>) is 134.14. This value can be interpreted as meaning that when no money is spent on advertising (when <em>X</em> = 0), the model predicts that 134,140 albums will be sold (remember that our unit of measurement is thousands of albums). The value of <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> is 0.096. This value represents the change in the outcome associated with a unit change in the predictor. In other words, if our predictor variable is increased by one unit (if the advertising budget is increased by 1), then our model predicts that 0.096 extra albums will be sold. Our units of measurement were thousands of pounds and thousands of albums sold, so we can say that for an increase in advertising of £1000 the model predicts 96 (0.096 × 1000 = 96) extra album sales. This investment is pretty useless for the record company: it invests £1000 and gets only 96 extra sales! Fortunately, as we already know, advertising accounts for only one-third of the variance in album sales.</p>
<p>If a predictor is having a significant impact on our ability to predict the outcome then its <em>b</em> should be different from 0 (and large relative to its standard error). The <em>t</em>-test (labelled <strong>statistic</strong>) and associated <em>p</em>-value tell us whether the <em>b</em>-value is significantly different from 0. The column <strong>p.value</strong> contains the exact probability that a value of <em>t</em> at least as big as the one in the table would occur if the value of <em>b</em> in the population were zero. If this probability is less than 0.05, then people interpret that as the predictor being a ‘significant’ predictor of the outcome. For both <em>t</em>s, the probabilities are given in scientific notation. For example for the effect of adverts the <em>p</em> is <code>2.91e-19</code>. This notation can seem confusing, but <code>e-x</code> is shorthand for <span class="math inline">\(\times 10^{-x}\)</span> and <code>e+x</code> is shorthand for <span class="math inline">\(\times 10^{x}\)</span>. Here’s two specific examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>2.91e-19</code> means <span class="math inline">\(2.91 \times 10^{-19}\)</span>, which in plain English means ’move the decimal place 19 places to the <em>left</em>. In other words, this number is 0.000000000000000000291. A very small number.</li>
<li><code>2.91e+19</code> means <span class="math inline">\(2.91 \times 10^{19}\)</span>, which in plain English means ’move the decimal place 19 places to the <em>right</em>. In other words, this number is 29100000000000000000. A very large number.</li>
</ul>
<p>With respect the values in the column <strong>p.value</strong>, it means that both values are zero to 3 decimal places (0.000), and so the probability of the <em>t</em> values (or larger) occurring if the values of <em>b</em> in the population were zero is less than 0.001. In other words, the <em>b</em>s are significantly different from 0. In the case of the <em>b</em> for advertising budget this result means that the advertising budget makes a significant contribution (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) to predicting album sales.</p>
<p>If our sample is one of the 95% producing confidence intervals that contain the population value then the confidence interval tells us that the population value of b for advertising budget is likely to fall between 0.077 and 0.115 and because this interval doesn’t include zero we might conclude that there is a genuine positive relationship between advertising budget and album sales in the population.</p>

</div>
<p>A bit of revision. Imagine that we collected 100 samples of data measuring the same variables as our current model. For each sample we estimate the same model that we have in this chapter, including confidence intervals for the unstandardized beta values. These boundaries are constructed such that in 95% of samples they contain the population value of <em>b</em>. Therefore, 95 of our 100 samples will yield confidence intervals for b that contain the population value. The trouble is that we don’t know if our sample is one of the 95% with confidence intervals containing the population values or one of the 5% that misses.</p>
<p>The typical pragmatic solution to this problem is to assume that your sample is one of the 95% that hits the population value. If you assume this, then you can reasonably interpret the confidence interval as providing information about the population value of <em>b</em>. A narrow confidence interval suggests that all samples would yield estimates of <em>b</em> that are fairly close to the population value, whereas wide intervals suggest a lot of uncertainty about what the population value of <em>b</em> might be. If the interval contains zero then it suggests that the population value of <em>b</em> might be zero – in other words, no relationship between that predictor and the outcome—and could be positive but might be negative. All of these statements are reasonable if you’re prepared to believe that your sample is one of the 95% for which the intervals contain the population value. Your belief will be wrong 5% of the time, though.</p>
<p>Looking at the 95% confidence interval for advertising (reproduced above), if our sample is one of the 95% producing confidence intervals that contain the population value then the confidence interval tells us that the population value of <em>b</em> for advertising budget is likely to fall between 0.077 and 0.115 and because this interval doesn’t include zero we might conclude that there is a genuine positive relationship between advertising budget and album sales in the population.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-using-the-model" class="section level3">
<h3>Using the model</h3>
<p>Let’s use the model to make some predictions. First, replace the <em>b</em>-values with the values from the output:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Sales}_i &amp; = b_0 + b_1\text{Advertising}_i+ \epsilon_i \\
\text{Sales}_i &amp; = 134.14 + (0.096\times\text{Advertising}_i)+ \epsilon_i \\
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>It is now possible to make a prediction about album sales, by replacing the advertising budget with a value of interest. For example, imagine a recording company executive wanted to spend £100,000 on advertising a new album. Remembering that our units are already in thousands of pounds, we can simply replace the advertising budget with 100. He would discover that album sales should be around 144,000 for the first week of sales:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Sales}_i &amp; = 134.14 + (0.096\times \text{Advertising}_i)+ \epsilon_i \\
\text{Sales}_i &amp; = 134.14 + (0.096\times \text{100})+ \epsilon_i \\
&amp;= 143.74
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-several-predictors" class="section level2">
<h2>Several predictors</h2>
<p>Let’s extend the model to include airplay and the band’s image as additional predictors. The executive has past research indicating that advertising budget is a significant predictor of album sales, and so the new predictors (airplay and attract) should be entered into the model <em>after</em> advertising budget. This method is <em>hierarchical</em> (the researcher decides in which order to enter variables into the model based on past research). The model we’re fitting is described by the following equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
Y_i &amp; = b_0 + b_1X_{1i}+ b_2X_{2i} + \ldots + b_nX_{ni} + \epsilon_i\\
\text{Sales}_i &amp; = b_0 + b_1\text{Advertising}_i+ b_2\text{Airplay}_i + b_3\text{Image}_i + \epsilon_i
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<div id="section-building-the-model" class="section level3">
<h3>Building the model</h3>
<p>We already have fitted a model predicting sales from advertising that is stored in <code>album_lm</code>. We’re now going to create a second model that builds upon this model by adding airplay and image as predictors. In other words, we’re building the model in the equation above.</p>
<p>To create this second model, we need to specify additional predictor variables in the same way that we add predictors to the equation itself: we use ‘+’ to add them into the model. So we change the formula within <code>lm()</code> from <code>sales ~ adverts</code> to <code>sales ~ adverts + airplay + image</code>. Note that the formula we use within <code>lm()</code> maps directly to the equation for the model but excludes the bs and the error term. Therefore, we can create this model by executing:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>album_full_lm &lt;- lm(sales ~ adverts + airplay + image, data = album_tib, na.action = na.exclude)</code></pre>
<p>Because we have no missing data the <code>na.action = na.exclude</code> is optional. This code creates a model in which sales is predicted from advertising, airplay and the band’s image and stores it in an object called <code>album_full_lm</code>. Try this in the code box:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="full_album" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="2">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":false,"error":false,"message":false,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>

<pre class="text"><code>album_full_lm &lt;- lm(sales ~ adverts + airplay + image, data = album_tib, na.action = na.exclude)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Note again that nothing seems to have happened, but actually the model has been created and stored. Next we need to extractinformation from it.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-fit-statistics" class="section level3">
<h3>Fit statistics</h3>
<p>As with our earlier model, we can obtain the (nicely formatted) fit statistics by placing the name of our model into glance():</p>
<pre class="r"><code>broom::glance(album_full_lm)</code></pre>
<p>Try this in the code box:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="album_full_lm_glance" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="2">

<pre class="text"><code>broom::glance(album_full_lm)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>As before, the variable <strong>r.square</strong> tells us the value of <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>. Remember that for the first model its value was 0.335, which we interpreted as advertising budget accounting for 33.5% of the variation in album sales. When the two new predictors are included, this value increases to 0.665 or 66.5% of the variance in album sales. If advertising accounts for 33.5%, then the change in <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(R^2_\text{change} = 0.665 - 0.335 = 0.33\)</span>. In other words, image and airplay account for an additional 33% of the variance in sales.</p>
<p>The adjusted <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> (adj.r.squared) gives us some idea of how well our model generalizes and ideally we’d like its value to be the same as, or very close to, the value of <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>. In this example the difference for the final model is small (it is 0.665 − 0.660 = 0.005 or about 0.5%). This shrinkage means that if the model were derived from the population rather than a sample we’d conclude that it accounted for approximately 0.5% less variance in the outcome.</p>

<p>The variable <strong>statistic</strong> contains the <em>F</em>-statistic. The <em>F</em>-statistic represents the ratio of the improvement in prediction that results from fitting the model, relative to the inaccuracy that still exists in the model. The variable <strong>p.value</strong> contains the <em>p</em>-value associated with <em>F</em>, which in this case is <span class="math inline">\(2.88 \times 10^{-46}\)</span>, in other words a lot smaller than 0.001. The degrees of freedom for the <em>F</em>-statistic are (in terms of these variables) <strong>df</strong>−1 and <strong>df.residual</strong>, so we could report <em>F</em>(3, 196) = 129.50, <em>p</em> &lt; .001. We can interpret this result as meaning that the model significantly improves our ability to predict the outcome variable compared to not fitting the model.</p>

<div id="section-comparing-models" class="section level3">
<h3>Comparing models</h3>
<p>We can compare hierarchical models using an <em>F</em>-statistic using the <code>anova()</code> function, which takes the general form:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>anova(model_1, model_2, … , model_n)</code></pre>
<p>Basically, within the function we list the models that we want to compare in the order in which we want to compare them. To compare the models album_lm and album_full_lm we could execute this code to get text output:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>anova(album_lm, album_full_lm)</code></pre>
<p>or use broom to tidy the output into a table for us:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>anova(album_lm, album_full_lm) %&gt;% 
  broom::tidy()</code></pre>
<p>Try this in the code box below.</p>
<p><font color='#E69F00'>We can only compare hierarchical models, in other words, that is to say that the second model must contain everything that was in the first model plus something new, and the third model must contain everything in the second model plus something new, and so on</font></p>

<p>The value of <em>F</em> is 96.45 (<strong>statistic</strong>) and the corresponding <em>p</em> (<strong>p.value</strong>) is <code>6.88e-30</code> (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(6.88 \times 10^{-30}\)</span>). The degrees of freedom for this <em>F</em> are the difference in the degrees of freedom between the two models (in this case 2 as shown in the variable <strong>df</strong>) and the degrees of freedom for the newer model (in this case 196 as shown in the variable <strong>res.df</strong>). Therefore, we can say that adding the predictors of image and airplay (<code>album_full_lm</code>) significantly improved the fit of the model to the data compared to having only advertising as a predictor (<code>album_lm</code>), <em>F</em>(2, 196) = 96.45, <em>p</em> &lt; .001. In other words, adding airplay and image as predictors significantly improved the model fit.</p>

<h3>Model parameters (<em>b</em>)</h3>
<p>As with our earlier model, we can obtain the parameter estimates and their confidence intervals as text by executing <code>summary(album_full_lm)</code> but it’s better to use <code>broom::tidy()</code> to get a nicely formatted table:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>broom::tidy(album_full_lm, conf.int = TRUE)</code></pre>

<p>The output gives us estimates for the <em>b</em>-values (column labelled <strong>estimate</strong>) and statistics that indicate the individual contribution of each predictor to the model. The <em>b</em>-values can be used to interpret the relationship between album sales and each predictor. All three predictors have positive <em>b</em>-values indicating positive relationships. So, as advertising budget increases, album sales increase; as plays on the radio increase, so do album sales; and finally more attractive bands will sell more albums. The <em>b</em>-values tell us more than this, though. They tell us to what degree each predictor affects the outcome if the effects of all other predictors are held constant.</p>

<p>We’ve looked at the band’s image, but for the other two predictors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertising budget: <em>b</em> = 0.085 indicates that as advertising budget increases by one unit, album sales increase by 0.085 units. Both variables were measured in thousands; therefore, for every £1000 more spent on advertising, an extra 0.085 thousand albums (85 albums) are sold. This interpretation is true only if the effects of band image and airplay are held constant.</li>
<li>Airplay: <em>b</em> = 3.367 indicates that as the number of plays on radio in the week before release increases by one, album sales increase by 3.367 units. Every additional play of a song on radio (in the week before release) is associated with an extra 3.367 thousand albums (3367 albums) being sold.

<p>Let’s summarize the values for the remaining predictors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertising budget: Standardized <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = 0.511 indicates that as advertising budget increases by one standard deviation (£485,655), album sales increase by 0.511 standard deviations. The standard deviation for album sales is 80,699, so this constitutes a change of 41,240 sales (0.511 × 80,699). Therefore, for every £485,655 more spent on advertising, an extra 41,240 albums are sold. This interpretation is true only if the effects of the band’s image and airplay are held constant.</li>
<li>Image: Standardized <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = 0.192 indicates that a band rated one standard deviation (1.40 units) higher on the image scale can expect additional album sales of 0.192 standard deviations units. This is a change of 15,490 sales (0.192 × 80,699). A band with an image rating 1.40 higher than another band can expect 15,490 additional sales. This interpretation is true only if the effects of airplay and advertising are held constant.</li>

<p>The quiz told you about the confidence interval for airplay, for the remaining predictors the confidence intervals tell us that <strong>assuming that each confidence interval is one of the 95% that contains the population parameter</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The true size of the relationship between advertising budget and album sales lies somewhere between 0.071 and 0.099.</li>
<li>The true size of the relationship between band image and album sales lies somewhere between 6.28 and 15.89.</li>
</ul>
<p>The two best predictors (advertising and airplay) have very tight confidence intervals indicating that the estimates for the current model are likely to be representative of the true population values.

<p>The output also contains the confidence intervals for each model parameter (<em>b</em>). The values in <strong>statistic</strong> are the values of <em>t</em> associated with each <em>b</em> and <strong>p.value</strong> is the associated significance of the <em>t</em>-statistic. For every predictor the <em>b</em> is significantly different from 0 (<em>p</em> &lt; .001), meaning that all predictors significantly predict album sales.</p>

<p>Many students and researchers think of <em>p</em>-values in terms of the ‘probability of a chance result’ or ‘the probability of a hypothesis being true’ but they are neither of these things. They are the long-run probability that you would get a test-statistic (in this case <em>t</em>) at least as large as the one you have if the null hypothesis were true. In other words, if there really were no relationship between advertising budget and album sales (the null hypothesis) then the population value of <em>b</em> would be zero. Imagine we sampled from this null population and computed <em>t</em>, and then repeated this process 1000 times. We’d have 1000 values of <em>t</em> from a population in which there was no effect. We could plot these values as a histogram. This would tell us how often certain values of <em>t</em> occur. From it we could work out the probability of getting a particular value of <em>t</em>. If we then took another sample, and computed <em>t</em> (because we’re kind of obsessed with this sort of thing) we would be able to compare this value of <em>t</em> to the distribution of all the previous 1000 samples. Is the <em>t</em> in our current sample large of small compared to the others? Let’s say it was larger than 999 of the previous values. That would be quite an unlikely value of <em>t</em> whereas if it was larger than 500 of them this would not surprise us. This is what a <em>p</em>-value is: it is the long run probability of getting test statistic at least as large as the one you have if the null hypothesis were true. If the value is less than 0.05, people typically take this as supporting the idea that the null hypothesis isn’t true.</p>
<p>The <em>p</em>-values in the table all tell us the long-run probability that we would get a a value of <em>t</em> at least as large as the ones we have if the the true relationship between each predictor and album sales was 0 (i.e., <em>b</em> = 0). In all cases the probabilities are less than 0.001, which researchers would generally take to mean that the observed <em>b</em>s are significantly different from zero. Given the <em>b</em>s quantify the relationship between each predictor and album sales, this conclusion implies that each predictor significantly predicts album sales.</p>

<h2>Unguided example 1: Metal and mental health</h2>
<p><span class="citation">(Lacourse, Claes, and Villeneuve 2001)</span> conducted a study to see whether suicide risk was related to listening to heavy metal music. They devised a scale to measure preference for bands falling into the category of heavy metal. This scale included heavy metal bands (Black Sabbath, <a href="https://ironmaiden.com/">Iron Maiden</a>), speed metal bands (<a href="https://www.slayer.net/">Slayer</a>, <a href="https://www.metallica.com/">Metallica</a>), death/black metal bands (Obituary, Burzum) and gothic bands (Marilyn Manson, Sisters of Mercy). They then used this (and other variables) as predictors of suicide risk based on a scale measuring suicidal ideation etc.</p>
<p>Data are in the tibble <code>metal_tib</code> are from a fictitious replication. There are two variables representing scores on the scales described above: <strong>hm</strong> (the extent to which the person listens to heavy metal music) and <strong>suicide</strong> (the extent to which someone has suicidal ideation and so on). Use the code box below to fit a model to predict suicide risk from love of heavy metal and to answer the questions below.</p>

<h2>Unguided example 2: predicting social anxiety</h2>
<p>In this example we’ll look at data collected from several questionnaires relating to clinical psychology, and we will use these measures to predict social anxiety. Anxiety disorders take on different shapes and forms, and each disorder is believed to be distinct and have unique causes. We can summarize the disorders and some popular theories as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social Anxiety: Social anxiety disorder is a marked and persistent fear of 1 or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or possible scrutiny by others. This anxiety leads to avoidance of these situations. People with social phobia are believed to feel elevated feelings of shame.</li>
<li>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD): OCD is characterized by the everyday intrusion into conscious thinking of intense, repetitive, personally abhorrent, absurd and alien thoughts (Obsessions), leading to the endless repetition of specific acts or to the rehearsal of bizarre and irrational mental and behavioural rituals (compulsions).</li>
</ul>
<p>Social anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder are seen as distinct disorders having different causes. However, there are some similarities. They both involve some kind of attentional bias: attention to bodily sensation in social anxiety and attention to things that could have negative consequences in OCD. They both involve repetitive thinking styles: social phobics ruminate about social encounters after the event (known as post-event processing), and people with OCD have recurring intrusive thoughts and images. They both involve safety behaviours (i.e. trying to avoid the thing that makes you anxious).</p>
<p>This might lead us to think that, rather than being different disorders, they are manifestations of the same core processes <span class="citation">(Field and Cartwright-Hatton 2008)</span>. One way to research this possibility would be to see whether social anxiety can be predicted from measures of other anxiety disorders. If social anxiety disorder and OCD are distinct we should expect that measures of OCD will not predict social anxiety. However, if there are core processes underlying all anxiety disorders, then measures of OCD should predict social anxiety. The data are in <code>soc_anx_tib</code>. This tibble contains three variables of interest to us:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI), which measures levels of social anxiety.</li>
<li>Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ), which measures the degree to which people experience obsessive beliefs like those found in OCD.</li>
<li>The Test of Self-Conscious Affect (TOSCA), which measures shame.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of 134 people was administered all questionnaires. Fit a hierarchical linear model with two blocks:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Block 1: the first block will contain any predictors that we expect to predict social anxiety. In this example we have only one variable that we expect, theoretically, to predict social anxiety and that is shame (measured by the TOSCA).</li>
<li>Block 2: the second block contains OBQ, the predictor variable that we don’t necessarily expect to predict social anxiety.</li>
</ol>
<p>Use the code box to fit this model and answer the questions below.</p>
