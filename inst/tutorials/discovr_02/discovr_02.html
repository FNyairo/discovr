Once you have been at space pirate academy for a while, you get your own funky visor. It has various modes. My favourite is the one that allows you to see everything as a large plate of tuna. More important, sections marked for cat-dets with visors goes beyond the core material but is still important and should be studied by all cat-dets. However, try not to be disheartened if you find it difficult. For accessibility, these sections will also be labelled with (2).</li>

Those almost as brilliant as Mae (because no-one is quite as brilliant as her) get their own space suits so that they can go on space pirate adventures. They get to shout <em>RRRRRR</em> really loudly too. Actually, everyone here gets to should <em>RRRRRR</em> really loudly. Try it now. Go on. It feels good. Anyway, this material is the most advanced and you can consider it optional unless you are a postgraduate cat-det. For accessibility, these sections will also be labelled with (3).</li>

For example, if I want to use the <code>mutate()</code> function from the package <code>dplyr</code>, I will write <code>dplyr::mutate()</code>.</p>
<p>It is good practice to be explicit about packages to avoid clashes where functions from different packages have the same name. It also means that you don’t need to load packages at the start of your markdown document.</p>
<p>There are two main exceptions to this rule.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>There are functions within some <code>tidyverse</code> packages that would be used within other functions. Including the package name makes the code difficult to read. Also, no-one wants to write <code>ggplot2::</code> before every function from <code>ggplot2</code>.</li>
<li>To use the pipe operator (<code>%&gt;%</code>) you need to have <code>magrittr</code> loaded.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can load all of the packages that are exceptions in one step by loading <code>tidyverse</code> at the beginning of our <svg style="height: 1em; top:.04em; position: relative; fill: #136CB9;" viewBox="0 0 581 512"><path d="M581 226.6C581 119.1 450.9 32 290.5 32S0 119.1 0 226.6C0 322.4 103.3 402 239.4 418.1V480h99.1v-61.5c24.3-2.7 47.6-7.4 69.4-13.9L448 480h112l-67.4-113.7c54.5-35.4 88.4-84.9 88.4-139.7zm-466.8 14.5c0-73.5 98.9-133 220.8-133s211.9 40.7 211.9 133c0 50.1-26.5 85-70.3 106.4-2.4-1.6-4.7-2.9-6.4-3.7-10.2-5.2-27.8-10.5-27.8-10.5s86.6-6.4 86.6-92.7-90.6-87.9-90.6-87.9h-199V361c-74.1-21.5-125.2-67.1-125.2-119.9zm225.1 38.3v-55.6c57.8 0 87.8-6.8 87.8 27.3 0 36.5-38.2 28.3-87.8 28.3zm-.9 72.5H365c10.8 0 18.9 11.7 24 19.2-16.1 1.9-33 2.8-50.6 2.9v-22.1z"/></svg> Markdown document:</p>

<p>We will use data about memes, which typically have a common pattern: they start small, rapidly expand in popularity and then die out. Specifically we’ll use data from the ice bucket challenge. You can check Wikipedia for the full story, but it all started (arguably) with golfer Chris Kennedy tipping a bucket of iced water on his head to raise awareness of the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease). The idea is that you are challenged and have 24 hours to post a video of you having a bucket of iced water poured over your head. In this video you also challenge at least three other people. If you fail to complete the challenge your forfeit is to donate to charity (in this case ALS). Many people completed the challenge and made donations.</p>
<p>The ice bucket challenge generated something like 2.3 million on YouTube. The data are stored in <span class="alt">ice_tib</span>, which contains one variable <strong>upload_day</strong> that is the number of days after Chris Kennedy’s initial challenge that each of 2,323,452 ice bucket related videos were uploaded to YouTube. For example, if the value is 21 it means that the video was uploaded 21 days after Chris Kennedy’s initial challenge. We can’t see the pattern of the data easily from 2,323,452 scores.

<p>The frequency table that we just produced is large and a little unwieldy. It might be useful to instead have a table that counts the frequencies for a range of scores. For example, how many videos were uploaded between 21 and 24 days, and 25 and 28 days. This is known as a <em>grouped</em> frequency distribution. To produce one of these, first we have to place the values of <strong>upload_days</strong> into what are known as <em>bins</em>. The values of the number of days range from 21 to 76 days after Chris Kennedy’s initial challenge. Imagine we wanted to group the data in such a way as to see how many videos were uploaded every 4 days (instead of every day). To do this, we’d need to group the values of days into bins of 21-24, 25-28, 29-32 and so on. Notice that each ‘bin’ is made up of 4 days worth of values.</p>

<p>Notice that each value of <strong>upload_day</strong> now has a corresponding value of <strong>days_group</strong> containing the ‘bin’ to which the score has been assigned. For example, the first score of 34 has been assigned to the bin labelled <code>(30, 34]</code>. This is the bin containing any score above 30 up to and including 34. The label uses standard mathematical notation for sets where <code>(</code> or <code>)</code> means ‘not including’ and <code>[</code> or <code>]</code> means ‘including’.</p>
</div>
<p>Having done this we can again use <code>summarize()</code> and <code>n()</code> to count the scores like we did before. However, this time we want to group the summary by <strong>days_group</strong> instead of <strong>upload_day</strong>. Doing so means that the number of times a score falls within each bin will be counted rather than the number times each score occurs.</p>

<p>If we want to calculate the relative frequency (i.e., the proportion of videos uploaded during each of the time periods represented by the bins) we can use <code>dplyr::mutate()</code> to add a variable that divides the frequency by the total number of videos uploaded. We can find this total using <code>sum()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>... %&gt;% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    relative_freq = frequency/sum(frequency)
  )</code></pre>
<p>Within the <code>mutate()</code> function we create a new column called <strong>relative_freq</strong> using <span class="alt">frequency/sum(frequency)</span>. The effect of this command is that for each value of the variable <strong>frequency</strong> within <span class="alt">gp_freq_dist</span>, a new value is computed that is the original value divided by the sum (or total) of all of the frequencies. This process converts the raw frequency into a relative frequency.</p>

<p>As well as tabulated frequency distributions, we can visualise distributions using histograms. <code>ggplot2</code> is a powerful package for producing data visualisations that we will explore in detail in the <strong>discovr_05</strong> tutorial.

<p>We’ve discussed elsewhere that if you include packages when you use functions (e.g., <code>dplyr::mutate()</code>) you don’t need to explicitly load the package (in this case <code>dplyr</code>). However, to create plots with <code>ggplot2</code> you build them up layer by layer, which means you use a lot of <code>ggplot2</code> functions. For this reason, I advise loading it at the start of your markdown document and not worrying too much about including package references when you use functions. You can load it either with <code>library(ggplot2)</code> or by loading the entire tidyverse using <code>library(tidyverse)</code>.</p>

<pre class="r"><code>`ggplot2::ggplot(my_tib, aes(variable_for_x_axis, variable_for_y_axis))`</code></pre>
<p>Within the <code>ggplot()</code> function replace <span class="alt">my_tib</span> with the name of the tibble containing the data you want to plot, and within the <code>aes()</code> function replace <span class="alt">variable_for_x_axis</span> with the name of the variable to be plotted on the <em>x</em>-axis (horizontal), and replace <span class="alt">variable_for_y_axis</span> with the name of the variable to be plotted on the <em>y</em>-axis (vertical).</p>
<p>To plot the days since the first ice bucket challenge video that each video was uploaded, we could execute the code below, which uses the tibble called <span class="alt">ice_tib</span>, and plots the variable <strong>upload_day</strong> on the <em>x</em> axis (for a histogram we don’t need to specify <em>y</em>). Try it.</p>

<p>Don’t worry, you haven’t done anything wrong: this command tells <code>ggplot2</code> <em>what</em> to plot, but not <em>how</em> to plot it. We need to add something called a <strong>geom</strong> to display the data. For a histogram we use <code>geom_histogram()</code>.</p>

<p>By default <code>ggplot2</code> constructs the bins of the histogram to be 1/30th the width of the data. You can over-ride this default by specifying <span class="alt">binwidth =</span> within the <code>geom_histogram()</code> function. In the code box below, type <span class="alt">binwidth = 1</span> into the brackets after <code>geom_histogram()</code> and execute the code. Note how the histogram changes. A binwidth of 1 makes sense for these data because responses could only be whole numbers (days), but try some other values and note how the histogram changes.</p>

<p>Arguments within functions often have admissible values, an example would be that alpha <em>must</em> fall between 0 and 1. If you set a value outside of an argument’s range, the argument is usually ignored, or you’ll get an error. If changing a value within a function appears to have no effect (or you get an error) check that you have used admissible values. In the current example, check you haven’t included <span class="alt">alpha = 100</span>.</p>

<p>To change the labels on the <em>x</em>- and <em>y</em>-axis we can use the <code>labs()</code> function. To do this, we add a <code>+</code> after the <code>geom_histogram()</code> function and on the next line type:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>labs(y = &quot;label_for_y_axis&quot;, x = &quot;label_for_x_axis&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Replacing <span class="alt">label_for_y_axis</span> with the text we want on the <em>y</em>-axis and <span class="alt">label_for_x_axis</span> with the text that we want on the <em>x</em>-axis. For the current plot, we are plotting the frequency of uploads (because it’s a histogram) on the <em>y</em>-axis and the number of days since the original ice bucket challenge on the <em>x</em>-axis, so we might use:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>labs(y = &quot;Frequency&quot;, x = &quot;Days since first ice bucket challenge video&quot;)</code></pre>

<p><code>ggplot2</code> has various built in themes that change the appearance of the plot. The two we will use most often are <code>theme_bw()</code>, which applies a black and white theme and <code>theme_minimal()</code> which applies a minimalist theme. Both of these themes are good for scientific plots (like the ones you’ll find in journal articles).</p>

<p>To apply a theme we add <code>+</code> after the previous function and then type <code>theme_bw()</code> or <code>theme_minimal()</code>. For example, to apply a minimalist theme to our histogram code we’d use the code below. Note that we have taken the code from the previous section and simply tagged <code>+ theme_minimal()</code> to the end. Compare the result to the previous version of the histogram.</p>

<p>We’ve seen already that functions take the form of a command followed by brackets. We also saw that there are usually options that can be placed within those brackets (for example, in the previous section we changed the binwidth and bar colour of the histogram by placing instructions within the <code>geom_histogram()</code> function). We’ll explore this idea more by looking at the function to estimate the mean and median of the ice bucket scores.</p>

<p>We can compute the mean using the built-in function <code>mean()</code>. The full format of the function is:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mean(variable, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE)</code></pre>
<p>Which just says that you need to include a reference to the variable/data that you want the mean for, and that you can set two arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="alt">trim</span>: allows you to trim the scores before calculating the mean by specifying a value between 0 and 0.5. The default is 0 (no trim), but if you wanted to trim 10% of scores from each end of the distribution you could set <span class="alt">trim = 0.1</span>, similarly to trim 20% from each end before computing the mean set <span class="alt">trim = 0.2</span>.</li>
<li><span class="alt">na.rm</span>: you’ll see this argument in many functions, it stands for ‘NA remove’.

<p>If you are happy with the default settings you don’t need to specify those arguments explicitly. For example, to find the mean of the variable <strong>upload_day</strong> from the <span class="alt">ice_tib</span> tibble, we could execute:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="ice_mean_ce1" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>mean(ice_tib$upload_day)</code></pre>

</div>
<p>However, if we wanted to remove missing values we need to override the default setting for the <span class="alt">na.rm</span> argument:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="ice_mean_ce2" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">

<p>We can use the <code>round()</code> function to round values. It</p>
<pre class="r"><code>round(value, number_of_decimal_places = 0)</code></pre>
<p>In which we input a <span class="alt">value</span>, and specify the number of decimal places we want (the default is 0, which returns a whole number). For example, to round the value 3.211420 to a whole number we would execute:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>round(3.211420)</code></pre>
<p>But to round it to two decimal places we would include the number two after a comma:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>round(3.211420, 2)</code></pre>
<p>We could also use a pipe to feed a mean, median or variance into the round function. For example, to round the value of the variance of <strong>upload_day</strong> to 3 decimal places we could execute:</p>

<p>The code looks like this in general:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ice_tib %&gt;%
  dplyr::summarise(
    median =  median(upload_day),
    mean =  mean(upload_day),
    ...
    ) %&gt;%
    round(., 2)</code></pre>
<p>The code feeds the data stored in <span class="alt">ice_tib</span> into the <code>summarise()</code> function. In this function new variables are created. The first variable we name <code>median</code> and it stores the output of <code>median(upload_day)</code>. In other words, we create a variable that we chose to call <code>median</code> (left hand side of the command) that stores the value of the median of the variable <strong>upload_day</strong> (right-hand side of the command). Similarly, we store the mean upload day in a variable called <strong>mean</strong> and so on. We can add as many new variables as we wish, but for the last variable we create we need to omit the comma at the end of the line (like we do when using <code>mutate()</code>). Finally, we pipe all of these values into the <code>round()</code> function, which rounds them to two decimal places.</p>
