There are several ways to enter the Oxoby data, here's one of them:

```{r 1_1, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
oxoby_tib <- tibble::tibble(.rows = 36) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    	singer = c(rep("Bon Scott", 18), rep("Brian Johnson", 18)) %>% forcats::as_factor(),
    	offer = c(1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5)
    	) 

# You can go on to save this tibble to a csv in your data folder using:

oxoby_tib %>% 
  readr::write_csv(., here::here("data/acdc.csv"))
```
